# C=

## Compiler

This is the first implementation of a compiler for the C-Equal (C=) language.

## Language

The C-Equal (C=) language takes a subset of C, and add some important modern features to it.

### Syntax
The syntax is very much C-Like, using braces and semicolon, but it adds some sugar usually found in higher level languages while remaining as simple as possible.
For more details see 'syntax.md'.
